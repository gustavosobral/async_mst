# Async MST

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/gustavosobral/async_mst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gustavosobral/async_mst)

An asynchronous Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) implementation on a distributed system using an synchronous algorithm with Alpha Synchronizer.

## Dependencies
You can check the TravisCI configuration file to see how to solve dependencies on Ubuntu OS. Basically, just with a version of [MPICH2](http://www.mpich.org/downloads/) installed you be able to compile and run the code.

## Special thanks
I would like to thank you all the contributors of the [MPI Tutorial](http://mpitutorial.com/) website, which helped me a lot, providing useful and relevant resources about MPI programming.
